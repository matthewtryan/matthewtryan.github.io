      <p><font size="5" color="4e4e4f">On this page, I have included projects that were completed for this course and demonstrate my improved technical communication abilities. 
</br></br>
English 202C is a technical writing course that is designed for scientists and engineers at Penn State to provide them with the knowledge to communicate technical ideas more effectively. Below, there are links and descriptions of two projects from this course that display the type of work that was completed.
</br></br>
The Process Description project showed me how to efficiently yet clearly describe a complex scientific process to a wider audience of readers. It was important to consider that certain terms and techniques that are commonplace in the scientific community are not common-knowledge to those outside of it. 
</br></br>
The Instruction Set was a project that required me to select a procedure and outline a document on how to complete the procedure along with background information about it. Instruction sets are common in many disciplines this allowed me to gain experience writing this type of document which is useful when describing how to replicate an experiment to another researcher. Moreover, this was completed with a scientific audience in mind so common terms were not defined. The main takeaway from this project was to stress how important it is to include even the most basic step as those who have never completed the task will be unable to replicate it if subtleties are assumed. </font></p>
