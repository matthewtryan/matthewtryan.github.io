      <p><font size="5" color="4e4e4f">I am a Junior Immunology and Infectious Disease major at The Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA. I will be graduating in May of 2018 and plan to attend graduate school upon graduation and obtain a Masterâ€™s Degree in either Microbiology or Global Epidemiology. 
</br></br>
On this page, you will be able to view sample work from projects I have completed for other courses that emphasize my scientific reasoning and technical working. Each work presented will contain a brief description for context regarding the assignment and its relevance to my future career. 
</br></br>
My <a href="https://github.com/matthewtryan/matthewtryan.github.io/raw/master/Bio230WReportEnglish202C.pdf"> lab report</a> for Molecular Biology was completed in my Sophomore year and is a class that focuses on the microscopic aspects of cellular interactions. This report analyzes Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) cDNA libraries in an attempt to determine if it is an appropriate model organism for human disease. The report highlights my ability to construct a report that incorporates background research on the topic along with my ability to analyze collected data and my comfort with the lab techniques in this report. Additionally, this report was completed with a lab partner and displays my comfort with working in small groups to complete a task. 
</br></br>
My <a href="https://github.com/matthewtryan/matthewtryan.github.io/raw/master/Micrb415PaperReviewMatthewRyan%20FINAL.pdf"> literature review</a> for General Virology was completed in my Junior year and is a class that emphasizes the classification and pathogenesis of many types of viruses. The review analyzes a primary literature article on Mimivirus and highlights the important information and scientific techniques that were utilized to discover and research this virus. This report shows my ability to read and comprehend primary literature articles, an everyday task in the life of a biological scientist, and to concisely and informatively discuss the main points of the article. 
</br></br>
My <a href="https://github.com/matthewtryan/matthewtryan.github.io/raw/master/Chem111WaterHardness.pdf"> other lab report</a> that was completed for Introductory Chemistry Laboratory was completed in my freshman year and is a class that teaches basic laboratory etiquette and useful techniques in working with chemical compounds. The report delves into varying water hardness levels throughout the Penn State campus and potential reasons for these discrepancies. This was included to point out my experience in chemistry laboratory work in addition to my biological experience. Moreover, the document is over twenty pages long and contains numerous tables, graphs, and images which demonstrates my ability to present, analyze, and explain copious amounts of data effectively. 
</br></br>
Lastly, my <a href="https://github.com/matthewtryan/matthewtryan.github.io/raw/master/MatthewRyanCholeraWrite-Up.pdf"> research paper</a> on the disease Cholera for Medical Microbiology was completed in my Junior year and is a class that discusses the pathogenesis of infectious microbial pathogens. It compiles information from primary literature sources regarding the treatment, epidemiology, and transmission of a particular microbe. This illustrates my ability to synthesize a concise research report from many different primary literature sources and to determine future steps for researching a microbe.</font></p>
