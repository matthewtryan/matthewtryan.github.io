      <h1><font color="black">About Me</font></h1>
      <p align="left"><font size="5" color="4e4e4f">I am Matthew T. Ryan, a Junior Immunology and Infectious Disease major at The Pennsylvania State University. Before this, I graduated from Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. I was an active participant in many extracurriculars from baseball to the astronomy club and received a senior award for Distinguished Academics. After taking a microbiology class in my Sophomore year of high school, I fell in love with infectious microbes and wanted to study their interaction with the immune system. Thus, I decided on an Immunology and Infectious Disease major.
</br></br>
Upon arriving at Penn State, I took many general biology, chemistry, and immunology classes to gain an understanding of complex microbial interactions. I received an academic scholarship from the College of Agricultural Sciences in my Freshmen year. I have been on the Dean's List twice and currently maintain a GPA of 3.53/4.00.
</br></br>
In my freshman year, I joined the <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/clubsports/clubs/floor-hockey/">Penn State Club Floor Hockey Team </a> as a goaltender and became the captain in my Sophomore year. I was also elected as Secretary of the club in my Sophomore year and re-elected in my Junior year following the increased success of the club.
</br></br>
I am a Laboratory Teaching Assistant in Molecular Biology where I am responsible for grading research papers and teaching students proper writing and technical laboratory skills. In my Sophomore year, I was a Lecture Assistant for Introductory Biology and held office hours to discuss past exam questions with students and help them with difficult concepts presented in class.
</br></br>
In the summer of 2017, I will be completing an <a href="http://drexel.edu/medicine/Research/Student-Research/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowship/">Undergraduate Research Fellowship </a> at Drexel University where I will be working with a team to construct a research project and present my findings at an end of summer conference.
</br></br>
My short term goals are to be on the Dean's List for the rest of my semesters at Penn State and to publish a research paper before I graduate. In the future, I hope to obtain a Master's Degree in either Microbiology or Global Epidemiology which will allow me to pursue a career working for the Center of Disease Control or the World Health Organization. Here, I would like to help track the spread of infectious diseases and determine the most effective response for epidemics.
